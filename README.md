# Content-Monetization-Modeler-

The Content Monetization Modeler is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts YouTube ad revenue based on video performance metrics such as views, likes, comments, watch time, and subscriber count. The project involves complete data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns that influence monetization

# Project Summary

Developed a machine learning model to predict YouTube ad revenue using key video metrics such as views, likes, comments, watch time, and subscribers.

Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations in the dataset.

Built and compared multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluated model performance using RÂ² Score, RMSE, and MAE, where the Gradient Boosting model achieved the best accuracy.

Deployed the model in an interactive Streamlit web app, enabling users to input metrics and instantly predict potential ad revenue.
